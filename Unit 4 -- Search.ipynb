    "What about the complexity of the KMP algorithm? Computing the prefix table takes significant effort but in fact there is an efficient algorithm for doing it. Overall, the KMP algorithm has complexity $O(m + n)$. Since $n$ is usually enormously larger than $m$ (think of searching a DNA string of billions of bases), $m$ is usually dominated by $n$, so this means that KMP has effective complexity $O(n)$."

    "String search is an immensely important application in modern computing, and at least 30 efficient algorithms have been developed for the task. Many of these depend on the principle embodied in the quick search and KMP algorithms – shifting the target string an appropriate distance along the search string at each step, based on information in a table. The <b>Boyer–Moore</b> algorithm, for example, combines elements of both these two algorithms. This algorithm is widely used in practical applications.\n",
