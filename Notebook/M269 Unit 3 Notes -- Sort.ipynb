    "\n",
    "Sorting is the process of placing elements from a collection in some kind of order. This suggests that sorting is an important area of study in computer science and sorting also provides instructive examples of how algorithms and data structures work together, and of how the correct choice of data structure can make dramatic improvements in execution speed and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "An understanding of <b>recursion</b> allows us to consider more sophisticated procedures for sorting, notably quick sort, one of the fastest sorting algorithms. An understanding of recursive algorithms also leads also to the recognition that data structures themselves can be recursive. This insight is illustrated through an analysis of the heap sort algorithm, in which a recursive data structure known as a <b>heap</b> is used for the purposes of sorting."

    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "Suppose we have a collection, $C$, of items of data, (and we limit our discussion to dealing mostly with linear structures). Sorting $C$ means rearranging (reordering) its data items, based on an <b>ordering property</b> of each item, into ascending or descending order (and a reordering of a sequence has exactly the same items as the original sequence, but in a different order).\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is sorted into ascending order then if item $A$ comes before item $B$ it must also be true that $A \\leq B$, according to the particular ordering property we are using. If $C$ is sorted in descending order then we would have $A \\geq B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A formal, mathematical statement of sorting in, say, <i>ascending order</i> would run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of $n$ items $(x1, x2, …, xn)$, find a reordering $(x'_1, x'_2, ..., x'_n)$ such that $x'_1 \\leq x'_2 \\leq ... \\leq x'_n$.\n",

On the next pass it does the same with the next largest item, and so on, but the length of the section of the sequence over which further comparisons and swaps are made are reduced by 1 containing comparison to the unsorted portion. In this way, the items at the end, which are in their correct positions, no long need to be compared (as they have been sorted)."

The sum $n$ integers is $\\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n$ and thus the sum $n-1$ integers is $\\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n - n = \\frac{1}{2}n^2 - \\frac{1}{2}n$.

    "A bubble sort is often considered the most inefficient sorting method since it must exchange items before the final location is known. These “wasted” exchange operations are very costly. However, because the bubble sort makes passes through the entire unsorted portion of the list, it has the capability to do something most sorting algorithms cannot. In particular, if during a pass there are no exchanges, then we know that the list must be sorted. A bubble sort can be modified to stop early if it finds that the list has become sorted. This means that for lists that require just a few passes, a bubble sort may have an advantage in that it will recognize the sorted list and stop."
